To create a GitHub README for your HTML code, you can follow these steps:

1. **Description**: Provide a brief description of your project. For example:

   ```
   # Course Learning Page
   
   This is a responsive and interactive course learning page built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It includes features such as a video player, language selection, progress tracking, and dark mode toggle.
   ```

2. **Installation**: Provide instructions on how to run or use your project. Since this is a static HTML page, you can simply instruct users to open the HTML file in a web browser:

   ```
   ## Installation
   
   1. Clone the repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
      ```
   2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   ```

3. **Usage**: Describe how users can interact with your project and what each section does:

   ```
   ## Usage
   
   - The navigation bar at the top allows users to navigate between different sections of the course.
   - Section 1 contains a video player embedded from YouTube, along with language selection, progress tracking, and dark mode toggle options.
   - Section 2 is a placeholder for additional course content.
   ```

4. **Contributing**: Provide guidelines for others who may want to contribute to your project:

   ```
   ## Contributing
   
   Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
   ```

5. **License**: Specify the license under which your project is distributed. You can choose a license that suits your needs, such as MIT, Apache, or GNU:

   ```
   ## License
   
   This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
   ```

6. **Code**: Embed your HTML code within code blocks in the README to showcase it:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

Combining these elements, your GitHub README for the provided HTML code will look like this:

```markdown
